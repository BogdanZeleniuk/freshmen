There are three basic classes in project such as “Professor”, “Student”, “Group” and several added classes 
such as “JavaGroup”, “JavaScriptGroup”, “DotNetGroup”, “ClassBook” e.t.  to help represent objects and their 
relations with each other. With the help of method “selectPresentedStudents” professor can mark the students 
who are present or absent. With the object "StudentService" we can find the head/monitor of every group. 
There is also a ClassBook object that helps work with all the students (find students by name, sex). 
In the second part of this project there are tests for every method.
